The production of NURSE vowels in Nigerian English may vary across `linguistic` (vowel production and phonological context), `ethnicity` (Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba), and `sociological` (age, gender, profession). This hypothesis explains the effect of multilingual and diverse socio-cultural spaces on NURSE vowel production in Nigerian English.

To begin, **phonological context** may influence the production of NURSE vowels in Nigerian English. Unlike other studies that differentiate preceding from the following segment,  phonological context in this study is operationalized as the environment (preceding or following) of NURSE vowels in NE.

Also, **style** (e.g., broadcast talk and broadcast news) may contribute to the variation of NURSE vowels. 

**Ethnicity** is another key variable that could affect the realization of NURSE vowels in Nigerian English. Nigeria is home to numerous [major and minor] ethnic groups, each with its linguistic heritage and phonetic features. It is expected that speakers from different ethnic backgrounds may exhibit distinct vowel production influenced by their native languages, regional accents, and affiliations.

Furthermore, **gender** may play a role in the production of NURSE vowels, as studies have shown that men and women often exhibit differences in speech patterns and phonetic realizations. These gender-based differences could manifest in the production of NURSE vowels, with potential variations in vowel quality or duration.

Lastly, the **profession** might also contribute to variability in the production of NURSE vowels, as individuals in certain occupational groups may develop specialized speech patterns or mastery influenced by their professional domains.
