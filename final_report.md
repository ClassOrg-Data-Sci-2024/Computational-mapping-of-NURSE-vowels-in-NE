# Motivation for the study

The term `NURSE vowel` means vowels that are produced in similarity or variation to the mid-central vowel (e.g., `[ɜ]` as `[nɜs]` or `[nas]`). The existing literature contains information about NURSE vowel production, particularly in the inner circle of English (Englishes spoken in United States of America, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom). However, their findings often overgeneralize other Englishes (Englishes spoken as second/third language, e.g., Nigeria, Ghana, India, Bangladesh, Tanzania - outer circle of English) without providing any evidence. This study will investigate the phenomenon (NURSE vowel production) in the outer circle of English and provide a balanced description of the variation that characterizes the NURSE vowel production.

## Introduction

NURSE vowels have received scholarly attention in different *varieties* (especially in the inner circle) of English (e.g., *American English*, *British English*, *New Zealand English*). Their results were similar. First, the findings revealed the production of NURSE vowel as centralized vowel or maintaining a four-way contrast realized as [ɜ], [ɪ], [ɛ], and [ʌ] with varied level and presence of rhotics. These variant vowel realizations are influenced by social (e.g., _gender_, _age_), linguistic factors (e.g., _speech style_, _communtiy of practice_) and geographical locations of the speakers (e.g., _urban_ vs _rural_) (Li et. al., 2021; Maclagan et. al., 2017; Mayr, 2010; Mesthrie & Chevalier, 2014; Watson & Clark, 2013). These factors have continued to contribute to the variation in the production of NURSE vowels in Englishes. However, the variant forms of the production were discussed as categorical or gradient `r-less`.

## Research gap

However, very little is known about NURSE vowel variation in New Englishes like Nigerian English (NE), which exists in a rich multilingual context with regional varieties (i.e., Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba) and over 250 ethnic groups. This study bridges the  gap in the knowledge of NURSE vowel production in Englishes (between inner and outer circle of English).

- What are NURSE vowel production in NE?
- What possible factors determine variation in NURSE vowel production in NE?
- To what extent do phonetic features describe vowel identity of NURSE vowels?

## Research Hypothesis

The production of NURSE vowels in Nigerian English may vary across **linguistic** (vowel production and phonological context), **ethnicity** (Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba), and **sociolinguistic** (age, gender, profession) factors. This hypothesis explains the effect of multilingual and diverse sociocultural spaces on NURSE vowel production in Nigerian English. Specifically:

-	NURSE vowel may have variant production in NE

-	Phonological context may affect NURSE vowel production in NE

-	Nigeria has over 200 ethnic groups and three major (Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba); I hypothesize that ethnicity may determine NURSE vowel production in NE

-	Sociolinguistic factors may determine how NURSE vowels are produced in NE
These factors may contribute to the variation in the production of NURSE vowels than in monolingual speech context.
