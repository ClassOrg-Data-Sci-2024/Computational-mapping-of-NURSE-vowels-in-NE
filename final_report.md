# Motivation for the study

The term `NURSE vowel` means vowels that are produced in similarity or variation to the mid-central vowel (e.g., `[ɜ]` as `[nɜs]` or `[nas]`). The existing literature contains information about NURSE vowel production, particularly in the inner circle of English (Englishes spoken in United States of America, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom). However, their findings often overgeneralize other Englishes (Englishes spoken as second/third language, e.g., Nigeria, Ghana, India, Bangladesh, Tanzania - outer circle of English) without providing any evidence. This study will investigate the phenomenon (NURSE vowel production) in the outer circle of English and provide a balanced description of the variation that characterizes the NURSE vowel production.

## Introduction

NURSE vowels have received scholarly attention in different *varieties* (especially in the inner circle) of English (e.g., *American English*, *British English*, *New Zealand English*). Their results were similar. First, the findings revealed the production of NURSE vowel as centralized vowel or maintaining a four-way contrast realized as [ɜ], [ɪ], [ɛ], and [ʌ] with varied level and presence of rhotics. These variant vowel realizations are influenced by social (e.g., _gender_, _age_), linguistic factors (e.g., _speech style_, _communtiy of practice_) and geographical locations of the speakers (e.g., _urban_ vs _rural_) (Li et. al., 2021; Maclagan et. al., 2017; Mayr, 2010; Mesthrie & Chevalier, 2014; Watson & Clark, 2013). These factors have continued to contribute to the variation in the production of NURSE vowels in Englishes. However, the variant forms of the production were discussed as categorical or gradient `r-less`. In this study, I seek to contribute to the understanding of NURSE vowel variation in sociolinguistics, especially regarding language variation and change in New Englishes.

## Research gap

However, very little is known about NURSE vowel variation in New Englishes like Nigerian English (NE), which exists in a rich multilingual context with regional varieties (i.e., Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba) and over 250 ethnic groups. This study bridges the  gap in the knowledge of NURSE vowel production in Englishes (between inner and outer circle of English). 

- What are NURSE vowel production in NE?
- What possible factors determine variation in NURSE vowel production in NE?
- To what extent do phonetic features describe vowel identity of NURSE vowels?

## Research Hypothesis

The production of NURSE vowels in Nigerian English may vary across **linguistic** (vowel production and phonological context), **ethnicity&languages** (Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba), and **sociolinguistic** (age, gender, profession) factors. This hypothesis explains the effect of multilingual and diverse sociocultural spaces on NURSE vowel production in Nigerian English. Specifically:

-	NURSE vowel may have variant production in NE

-	Phonological context may affect NURSE vowel production in NE

-	Nigeria has over 200 ethnic groups and three major (Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba); I hypothesize that ethnicity may determine NURSE vowel production in NE

-	Socio-linguistic factors may determine how NURSE vowels are produced in NE
These factors may contribute to the variation in the production of NURSE vowels than in monolingual speech context.

# Methodology and Data

## Data [ICE-Nigeria]( http://ice-corpora.net/ice/index.html)

International Corpus of English (ICE) Nigeria (ICE-Nig) corpus comprises 609,581 spoken words and 400,796 written words. The corpus hosts `text files` and `audio files` for different discourse, including `broadcast news`, `broadcat talks`, `classroom conversations`, `non-broadcast` shows, `interviews`, `phone calls`, `conversations`, and `demonstrations` (Wunder et al., 2010). The website has a metadata Excel [file](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ice-nigeria/files/) that describes the background (`age`, `gender`, `ethnicity`, `profession`, type of `speech style`) of the participants. Only `broadcast news` and `broadcast talks` were sampled for this study because of the time frame. Specifically, attentions were be paid to different realizations of NURSE vowels across different `profession`, `gender`, `age`, and `ethnicity` in the sampled files. The sound and text files were downloaded and uploaded to [WebMAUS](https://clarin.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/BASWebServices/interface/WebMAUSBasic) for forced alignment. The textgrids were manually adjusted before the analysis. A total of [16 sound files] (https://github.com/ClassOrg-Data-Sci-2024/Sociophonetic-study-of-NURSE-vowels-in-Nigerian-English/blob/main/tidy_csv_files/nurse_social_var.csv) (broadcast news and broadcast talk) were analyzed.  

## Fast Track

Fast Track is an automated formant estimation in vowel analysis. The estimation maps vowel production every 2 milliseconds to capture the most continuous formant realization. In each millisecond that the script captures, it reports 5 formant levels, with the lowest as 4700Hz and the highest as 7550Hz. The estimate generates 20 formant samples and selects a winner after comparison with other possible formant outputs. Unlike previous studies of NURSE vowels that implemented midpoint and three-point vowel measurement, Fast Track captures 20 formant points for each vowel production. This algorithm has better formant representation than midpoint and three-point vowel measurement.

# Results and Discussion

In this section, I reported on the NURSE vowel variation by phonetic features, social variable and ethnicity.
