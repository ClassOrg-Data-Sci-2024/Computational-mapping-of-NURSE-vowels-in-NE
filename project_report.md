# Progress Report 1: 02/20/2024

I created the GitHub repository for my final project on sociophonetic study of NURSEvowels in Nigerian English. Similarly, I created files including `README.md` , `gitignore`, `project_plan`, and `progress_report.md`, `method.md.
README.md includes the project title, my name, and a project summary.
 
 - `.gitignore` includes `raw`, `Rhistory`, `RData`, `.wav`, `.RDataTmp`

 - `project_plan.md` has been created and contains information on the project's scope, as well as plans     for data manipulation and analysis.
 
  - `progress_report.md` has been created with the information that you are now reading



# Progress Report 2: 3/11/2024

-	I have updated the `method.md` file with the proposed method of data selection, elicitation, and analysis procedure. The document was created after reading a chapter on vowel annotation in the Sociophonetic Studentâ€™s Guide [read more](https://www.routledge.com/Sociophonetics-A-Students-Guide/Paolo-Yaeger-Dror/p/book/9780415498791). Since there is insufficient information on vowel boundaries and annotation on NE, the chapter is equipped with rationales for my decision. 


-	I have downloaded the audio and the text files. These files were forced aligned in the Web MAUS [Maus](https://clarin.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/BASWebServices/interface/WebMAUSBasic) 


-	The first phase of the data elicitation were limited to one speech style (broadcast news), and five     files had been annotated. I restricted the annotation to the news casters and news correspondences, the speeches that the correspondents interviewed during the news collection were not annotated. **Rationale** there are no documentation **meta data** of these categories of people on the ICE-Nig website. It is difficult to say about their ethnic affiliation, levels of education, age and gender which are the focus of the project.   


-	I am test-running FAST TRACK [read more](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/lingvan-2020-0051/html) to understand how formants are automatically extracted and calculated. After a successful understanding of the algorithm, I will complete annotating other files for `broadcast news` before adding other speech styles.


- It's herculean task to treat **audio files** and track where **NURSE vowels** are produced by the speakers. It's time consuming.
