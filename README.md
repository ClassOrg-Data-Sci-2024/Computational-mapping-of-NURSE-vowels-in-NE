### Summary
This study on the _**Socio-phonetic study of NURSE vowels**_ examines the phenomenon in a multilingual context unlike previous investigation of the phenomenon among inner circle Englishes. That said, there is a limit to what previous studies have explicated about the NURSE vowels in a linguistically diverse context. This study, therefore, provides insight into the production of NURSE vowels in a variety of **New Englishes** (e.g., Nigerian English) that has differences across speakers' ethnicities, regions and first language/mother tongue/L1.
