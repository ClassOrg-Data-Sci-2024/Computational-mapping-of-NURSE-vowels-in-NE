## Description

This study examines the phenomenon in a multilingual context, unlike previous investigations of the phenomenon among inner circle Englishes. That said, there is a limit to what previous studies have explained about the NURSE vowels in a linguistically diverse context. This study, therefore, provides insight into the production of NURSE vowels in a variety of **New Englishes** (e.g., Nigerian English) that have differences across speakers' ethnicity, region, and first language. The research questions are:

- How are NURSE vowels produced in NE?

- What variables might influence variance in NURSE vowel production in NE?

- To what extent do phonetic features describe the vowel identity of NURSE vowels?


## Data sets

The data for this study are hosted in the International Corpus of English [ICE-Nig]( http://ice-corpora.net/ice/index.html). The corpus has 609,581 spoken words and 400,796 written words. The corpus contains text and audio files for many discourses, such as broadcast news, broadcast lectures, classroom chats, non-broadcast programs, interviews, phone calls, conversations, and protests. The website includes a metadata Excel [file](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ice-nigeria/files/) that summarizes the participants' background (age, gender, ethnicity, and speaking style). The raw files I used are heavy, you can request of download it on the website. The processed and tidy spreadsheets are found in this [folder](https://github.com/ClassOrg-Data-Sci-2024/Sociophonetic-study-of-NURSE-vowels-in-Nigerian-English/tree/main/Analysis/tidy_csv_files)
